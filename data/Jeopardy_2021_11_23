1462985800505864192,2021-11-23T03:26:10.000Z,Amidst lighthearted football talk, I think it\u2019d be funny as hell if Peyton just threw out, \u201cHey Condi, is our democracy in jeopardy? What\u2019d ya think?\u201d (with Eli just nodding like good question) \U0001f602

I have the unusual distinction of having won once and lost twice on Jeopardy!
